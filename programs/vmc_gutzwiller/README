Codes for variational Monte Carlo (VMC) calculations for spin models (Heisenberg, J1-J2 model).
The variational wave functions are Gutzwiller-projected fermionic states, supplemented in some cases by a long-range spin-spin Jastrow factor.
Bash scripts to reproduce results in the dataset are collected in the "scripts" folder, together with the input files containing the optimal variational parameters.

Run compile.sh to compile codes. This requires Fortran and C compilers (assuming GNU compilers here) + LAPACK and BLAS libraries.
Compilation tested with the following compilers on a Linux machine:
-) GNU Fortran (Ubuntu 11.4.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 11.4.0
-) gcc (Ubuntu 11.4.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 11.4.0
