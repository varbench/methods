Code short description:

-) Prep_uniform_wf.f: Prepares the lattice and the variational wave function in the uniform case.
-) Prep_stripes_wf.f: Prepares the lattice and the variational wave function in the stripe case.
-) MC_uniform_wf.f: Performs the Monte Carlo run for optimizing the variational parameters in the uniform wave function and accumulating statistics for computing the energy.
-) MC_stripe_wf.f: Performs the Monte Carlo run for optimizing the variational parameters in the stripe wave function and accumulating statistics for computing the energy.
-) Random.c: Random number generator, to be compiled together with the Monte Carlo codes.
-) Parameters.f: Computes the optimal variational parameters after the Monte Carlo optimization run.
-) Energy.f90: Computes the energy and the energy squared after the Monte Carlo run.
-) Variance.f: Computes the variance, given the energy and the energy squared.

Bash scripts to reproduce results in the dataset are collected in the "scripts" folder, together with the input files containing the optimal variational parameters.
Run compile.sh to compile codes. This requires Fortran and C compilers (assuming GNU compilers here) + LAPACK and BLAS libraries.
